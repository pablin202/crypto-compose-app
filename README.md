# CryptoMarket Compose App

CryptoMarket Compose is an Android app developed in Kotlin that allows you to explore the most popular cryptocurrencies and obtain up-to-date market details. The app utilizes the following key technologies and features:

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose**: The app's user interface is built using Jetpack Compose, a modern declarative UI toolkit that simplifies the creation of interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

- **Hilt**: Hilt is used for dependency injection in the app. It provides an easy and safe way to manage and provide instances of classes that require dependencies.

- **Retrofit**: Retrofit is used for making calls to the cryptocurrency data API. It facilitates communication with the server and fetching real-time market details.

- **Clean Architecture - MVVM**: The app follows a clean architecture that clearly separates the presentation, business logic, and data access layers. The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern is used to manage the presentation logic and interaction with the data repository.
